# License Plate Recognition

License Plate Recognition is a computer vision project that utilizes OpenCV to detect and extract license plate regions from a live video feed or recorded video. It applies a Haar cascade classifier trained on license plate images to identify and draw bounding boxes around license plates in real-time.

## Requirements

To run the License Plate Recognition project, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2 module)
- NumPy

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install opencv-python numpy
## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/license-plate-recognition.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Download the SAmple video in link:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/12sBfgLICdQEnDSOkVFZiJuUE6d3BeanT/view"

4. Run the `main.py` script:

5. The program will start capturing video from the default camera. It will detect license plates in the video feed and draw bounding boxes around them. If a license plate is detected, you can press the 'a' key to save the corresponding region of interest (ROI) as an image.
